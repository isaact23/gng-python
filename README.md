# Python Terrain Source Generator

Generates Burst-compilable voxel terrain generator  
Later: Could create independent language that transpiles to C#  
OR use partial structs and add the remaining methods at compile time  
Roslyn source generation (define a separate solution, build it, then import the object into Unity)
